# parking_management_system
This Python code is a vehicle parking management system that tracks available parking spaces for bikes, autos, and cars. It manages parking by checking available spaces, records license plates upon entry, calculates the parking cost, and processes payments. It updates the available spaces after each vehicle's entry or exit and reports total profit.
